# simulation-spacecraft-moon-lander
Simulation the process travelling from Earth to land the Moon. 


# initial condition
- The space ship should launch near xich dao to have the greatest tangent velocity
r0 = ...
v0 = w x r0

- 3 stages of flight with different engines, I average the mass flow rate and exhausted velocity

# Flying strategy 
- stage1: take off and overcome Earth's gravity
+ use 5 F1 engines https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketdyne_F-1
+ avg Exhaust Velocity: 3600 m/s
+ mass flow rate: 4800 kg/s
 
- Stage2: 
 
# Parameters for spacecraft Saturn V
Combustion engine includes 3 stage:
-

the initial mass and landing mass 

#
after flying 2 hour -> increase velocity to 25000mph to exist earth orbit
